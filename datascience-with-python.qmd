## What is it?

### Problem-Solving

Data science is not just about working with data; it starts with a problem and the thinking process behind it. An establishment hires a data scientist because it thinks it has a problem that data can be used to address. At its core, data science is about problem-solving. The tools and methodologies used in data science evolve over time, but the fundamental problem-solving skills remain constant.

For example, newer techniques like `XGBoost` often outperform older algorithms such as `Random Forest`, though both serve the same purpose of making predictions based on data. What truly matters is the ability to think critically and approach problems with a willingness to learn.

Each phase of data science can be viewed as a problem-solving task. Defining the problem is the first challenge. You do not want to spend the time solving the wrong problem. Problem definition even determines what data needs to be collected. Collecting the right data in the appropriate amount is another problem that requires problem-solving skills. Analyzing the data to generate insights involves identifying patterns, trends, and relationships. For instance, a data scientist might analyze customer behavior to find which products are frequently purchased together and use this insight for targeted marketing campaigns.

#### Breaking Down Complex Problems

Problem-solving in data science involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. This helps in identifying key issues and developing focused strategies.

Critical thinking plays a crucial role in this process by evaluating information and making judgments. After defining the problem, one must:

1.  Brainstorm possible solutions.

2.  Evaluate them.

3.  Select the best one.

Critical thinking helps in understanding the assumptions and limitations of different solutions and models, guiding the selection of the most suitable one based on available evidence.

### The Analyst's Perspective

An analyst, even if not working directly with data, employs a reductionist view to find underlying elements. When the resource being analyzed is data, this person becomes a data analyst. However, analysts also need a synthetic approach to understand why certain data is produced, which involves considering the bigger picture and engaging with stakeholders and subject-matter expects.

### Analytical Thinking and Building Blocks

Analytical thinking involves understanding the building blocks or fundamentals and then constructing complex expressions from them. In programming, data types and operators are the basic building blocks. Understanding these primitives allows one to build more advanced computations. Similarly, in data science, understanding the basics of data manipulation and analysis is crucial for creating sophisticated models and solutions.

### Modeling and Reductionist Approach

Science often uses models to represent real-world phenomena, employing a reductionist approach to simplify complex realities. In data science, this can be seen in machine learning, where models are functions that take data as input and provide predictions as output. This approach allows for understanding and inferring real-world behaviors through simplified representations.
